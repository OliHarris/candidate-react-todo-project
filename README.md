# Todo Project

This was originally a test set, which I have since dropped into a fresh instance of Vite to continue building out.

:heavy_check_mark: Code in pure React / TypeScript

:heavy_check_mark: No jQuery

## Original specs

More can be built out here as per the original specs of the test listed below.

### Included in package.json

- react
- redux
- react-router
- bootstrap
- jest
- enzyme
- node-sass

### Task

Create a basic todo list using:

1. react
2. redux
3. react-router
4. bootstrap
5. SASS

By the end of the test, your application should:

1. List existing tasks :heavy_check_mark:
2. Check off 'done' tasks :heavy_check_mark:
3. Remove deleted tasks :heavy_check_mark:
4. Change the URL as the 'intent' of the UI shifts (e.g. /new)
5. Present a UI in Bootstrap with CSS customisations in SASS
6. Store all data with a sensible redux structure of stores and actions

#### Extra Credit

1. Demonstrate basic Jest/Enzyme tests
2. Comments :heavy_check_mark:
3. Sensible code structure :heavy_check_mark:

## Available Scripts

In the root directory you can run:

### `npm install`

Will perform a usual installation of any dependencies.

### `npm run dev`

Will perform a usual launch of the dev environment.

## NOTE:

As this is a Vite app, I hosted it on GitHub pages using this guide:
