# Todo Project

This was originally a [test set](https://github.com/PenguinOfWar/cra-redux-todo-test.git), which I have since dropped into a fresh instance of Vite to continue building out.

:heavy_check_mark: Code in pure React / TypeScript

:heavy_check_mark: No jQuery

## Available Scripts

In the root directory you can run:

### `npm install`

Will perform a usual installation of any dependencies.

### `npm run dev`

Will perform a usual launch of the dev environment.

## NOTE:

As this is a Vite app, I hosted it on GitHub pages using this guide:
